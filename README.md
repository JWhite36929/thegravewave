# The Grave Wave 
This is my final project for Intro to Game Programming. It is a "Vampire Survivor"-like game.

Unfortunately, the current state of the project mostly serves to be a proof of concept for a full game. The system revolves around the monster spawner, since it is an array of objects that determine what monsters spawn, when they start and stop spawning, how many spawn at a time, and the interval at which they spawn in. This modular design allows you to create a new enemy scene and then add it to the array to now have it in the game. The weapons have a modular design as well but come with a very verbose layout.
